          <h2> USEFUL PYTHON FOR DATA SCIENCE </h2>
          <p>In the two months since starting my job as a Production Engineer in
            the data science group at Natera, I’ve learned that having modular
            and reusable code is incredibly useful for when unexpected analyses
            and crises arise. Until recently, I would search through my
            growing number of Jupyter notebooks until I found code similar to
            what I was looking for and copy it over. Instead of opening five
            or six notebooks at a time, I decided to consolidate all of the
            common operations I perform on a daily basis into one notebook.
            And, to make it as widely applicable as possible, I decided to use
            the <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon'>open source
              Pokémon dataset</a> from Kaggle.</p>
          <p>I’ve put the notebook into CoLab, Google’s platform for shareable
            Jupyter notebooks. If you’d like to copy it for yourself and run it,
             the data I used can be found below.</p>
